<h3>The Hospitality Buzz is BACK and our most recent episode features our own Jeanine Cosgrove-Albert speaking with four leaders in the hospitality and food service industry on the experience of women in the workplace both before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The panelists discuss the importance of supporting other women in the workplace while also acknowledging the unfair factors that contribute to some women’s inability to advance their careers regardless of such support. Drawing from their personal experiences at Pepsico, Ecolab, GrubHub and Zee the Cook, our panel’s reflection on what it means to be a women in leadership throughout both their careers and in the pandemic specifically was eye opening and a must watch. </h3>

<h2><em>Students are eager to return to normal life on campus, but what does normal look like in 2021? With all we've experienced during the pandemic, will all the trappings of traditional campus life ever return at all or will the student and administrative experience be forever shaped by what we learned in 2020? We sat down with professionals from NYU, MIT and Harvard Law School to discuss what's next for higher-ed food service and hospitality.</em></h2>

<h1>I Have a Service Heart</h1><p class="">Snapshots of our AYS team &amp; their commitment to staying&nbsp;safe by wearing masks &amp; gloves and following our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/covid19" target="_blank">new safety COVID-19 protocols</a>.</p>


<hr /><h2>The AYS Team is Staying Safe &amp; Getting Back To Work with Service Hearts! </h2><p class="">To answer the call of our industry, At Your Service Staffing has added dedicated and reliable <a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/back-of-house-staff" target="_blank">back-of-the-house</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/services" target="_blank">healthcare foodservice</a> staffing divisions to our already robust hospitality services team. Our unwavering commitment to exceeding expectations is summed up by an overarching belief that <em>“Attitude is Everything</em>" and having a <strong>SERVICE HEART </strong>is at the core of our entire team and everything we do.&nbsp;</p><p class="">As our teams in <a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/about-locations" target="_blank">New York </a>and <a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/about-locations" target="_blank">Long Island</a> get back to work during these uncertain times, we took a moment to spotlight &amp; survey some leading AYS staff members. We  asked about their experiences providing services to our valued clients during <strong>COVID-19</strong> and what they do to make themselves&nbsp;&amp; guests feel safe and comfortable while performing their&nbsp;jobs.&nbsp;</p><p class="">We are so proud of our AYS family and the core belief that having a <a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/about" target="_blank">SERVICE HEART</a> sets our team apart from the rest. We all fundamentally believe that compassion can only be truly understood when it is practiced and we are committed to doing our part to take action, stay informed, and make change happen. </p><h2>Check Out Insights From Our Service Heart Q&amp;A with AYS Team:</h2>


<hr /><h3><strong>Q: Since COVID-19 started, how has your job changed?&nbsp;</strong></h3><blockquote><p class=""><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Since COVID-19 started, all necessary precautions were instituted at the catering sites. We were asked to wear masks, gloves and to keep our distance from each other.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><h3><strong>Q: During COVID-19, what have you done to feel safe &amp; comfortable while performing your job?</strong></h3><blockquote><p class=""><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;<em>It feels necessary to always go to the job site well before the "call time." For me, that means arriving 1/2 hour to 1 hour prior to the call time. This helps me to understand the lay of the grounds, see where I'll be working, watch other staff go about their jobs and really understand what the client is going to expect of me.</em></p></blockquote><h3><strong>Q: During COVID-19, what have you done to help others feel safe &amp; comfortable while performing your job?&nbsp;</strong></h3><blockquote><p class=""><strong><em>A:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Can you see me smiling? Sticking out my tongue? No?! Ahhhh, the mask. LOL!!!&nbsp; So, I wave, give a thumbs up, do a little happy dance, introduce myself to other staff members (from a safe distance), and try to be as helpful and accommodating as I can while I&nbsp;do my job. Also, I find that acknowledging people and asking them if they are "ok" and saying " how are you"&nbsp; are good cheerful conversation starters that help set the tone for a great shift prior to guest arrival.&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>We are so proud of our AYS family and the core belief that having a service heart sets our team apart from the rest. We all fundamentally believe that compassion can only be truly understood when it is practiced and we are committed to doing our part to take action, stay informed, and make change happen.</em></p></blockquote>

<h2>Our Talented AYS Team Members Are Doing Their Part &amp; Staying Safe! </h2><p class="">There is zero chance that COVID-19 could keep us from shouting out some of our leading AYS team members! For this edition of our <strong>Service Heart Spotlight</strong>, we surveyed three of our all-star staff members, Juan, Mary &amp; Jordan and highlighted some feedback&nbsp;from the AYS leadership on the impact these three have on our teams and client events. </p><p class="">These AYS team players from <a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/about-locations" target="_blank">Baltimore</a>, <a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/about-locations" target="_blank">Long Island</a> and <a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/about-locations" target="_blank">Boston</a>, not only shared some key insights on how to provide the highest level of service to our valued clients, but they also shared photos of their commitment to wearing masks &amp; gloves and following our <a href="https://www.aysstaff.com/covid19" target="_blank">new safety policies &amp; CDC procedures</a>. </p>


<hr /><blockquote><p class="">“Juan Causey, is the face and anchor of the Baltimore team and provides top service, second to none. Juan was the first AYS hired employee on the Baltimore team and rises to every challenge set before him. He is a true mentor and excels at educating all staff. Juan has an eye for detail and makes sure that if something needs to gets done, it will get done correctly! Juan is one of our leading captain and beloved by many clients, he puts them at ease when they see he is working their event. Juan is one of the true backbones of the AYS family and his passion for providing amazing service truly makes our company shine. From high volume to refined elevated service, Juan is your guy.” — AYS BALTIMORE TEAM LEADER</p></blockquote>

<hr /><p class="">Recently, we saw another version of the graphic above circulating on our social media channels, so, we decided to put our own AYS spin on it! The original post focused on “how to support a small business for free” and listed all the actions online communities could do to virtually support teams they care about — without paying a dime. </p><h2>This got us thinking.  </h2><p class="">Over the last several weeks of quarantine, our industry, business and team has been directly impacted by the effects of COVID-19. Even our own AYS&nbsp;VP,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAHn7D0BlI3fIFQd1PzfcG1nfwEMHEv1H2s">Jeanine Cosgrove-Albert</a> recently contributed her point of view for a <a href="https://bit.ly/DEVMEDIACOVID" target="_blank">DevMedia &amp; Events blog post</a> on how the&nbsp;pandemic&nbsp;has changed our industry and gave advice to safely navigate the path forward when events return. </p><p class="">During these uncertain times, we have leaned into our event &amp; hospitality networks to find ways to learn, evolve, keep connected &amp; stay safe. Our main takeaway is that NOW, more than ever, we have an amazing opportunity to interact &amp; engage with our online community and set the course for what comes next.  </p><h2>This is where we need your help!&nbsp;</h2><p class="">Whether you are a loyal client, previous employee or hospitality industry professional with advice to give, AYS would love to hear from you! For us, there is nothing more important to our continued growth and success then client &amp; employee reviews and testimonials. We take your feedback very seriously and we will continue to work very hard to ensure every event, no matter how big or small, is a success. We sincerely thank you for your virtual help to support the growth of our business! We’ve got this &amp; we are stronger together! </p><h2>Please provide invaluable feedback &amp; reviews below:</h2>
